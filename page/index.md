\begin{section}{title="About the dataset", name="About"}

This page presents a dataset containing information on carbon pricing mechanisms (carbon taxes or cap-and-trade) introduced around the world since 1990. To date, it is the most comprehensive attempt at providing a systematic description of carbon pricing mechanisms in terms of their sectoral (and fuel) coverage as well as the associated price signal.

The dataset currently covers 198 national jurisdictions and 98 sub-national jurisdictions (50 US States, 13 Canadian Provinces and Territories, 3 Japanese Municipalities, 32 Chinese Provinces and Municipalities). It records their institutional development (sectoral and fuel coverage as well as price) from 1990 (year of introduction of the first carbon pricing mechanism in Finland) to this day (currently, 2018 is the last year for which data has been collected).

The database records information on the coverage and price associated with mechanisms placing a price on CO2 emissions at the sector-fuel level. It records separately information about carbon taxes and cap-and-trade mechanisms.

\begin{section}{title="Pricing carbon: a summary"}

Charging a price on CO2 (and other greenhouse gases) emissions is one of the
instruments used to reduce them. It has long been favoured by economists as an
efficient way of achieving emission reductions.

The first carbon pricing mechanism was introduced in Finland in 1990. Since then,
a number of national and subnational jurisdictions have adopted such mechanisms.
To date, there are [xx] jurisdictions with carbon taxes and [xx] jurisdictions with
an emissions trading system.

Some of the existing schemes are regional. For instance, 30 national jurisdictions
participate in the European Union Emission Trading System and 9 US states
are part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

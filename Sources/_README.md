# Sources
The present folder contains a 'master' file, which contains all citations referring to the sources of recorded data, and a series of references files, which contain the full reference of the cited sources.

The structure of the 'master' file mimicks that of the dataset. That is, there is one entry (one row) for each *jurisdiction-year-sector* or, when applicable, *jurisdiction-year-sector-fuel* combination.

A reference is provided for every single data point recorded. For instance, the `Sweden-1997-Manufacturing-Coal` entry of the `Tax_dummy` variable contains the citation [xx]. 

The referencing structure is as follows: DocumentType(Tag[Year]). For example, the reference for the `Tax_dummy` data point corresponding to the `Sweden-1997-Manufacturing-Coal` entry is 'Report(WB[2014])'.

The full reference corresponding to this citation can then be looked up in the relevant .csv file. The reference of the 'Report(WB[2014])' citation can be found in the `Report.csv` file.
